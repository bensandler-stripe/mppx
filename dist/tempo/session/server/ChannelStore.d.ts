/**
 * State for an on-chain payment channel, including per-session accounting.

 * the server has accepted, and the current session's spend counters.
 * A channel is created when a payer opens an escrow on-chain and persists
 * until the channel is finalized (closed/settled).
 *
 * One channel = one session. The client owns the key and can't race with
 * itself, so concurrent session support is unnecessary.
 *
 * Monotonicity invariants (enforced by update callbacks):
 * - `highestVoucherAmount` only increases
 * - `settledOnChain` only increases
 * - `deposit` reflects the latest on-chain value
